Student Class — Time & Space Complexity

The Student class does not use loops or recursion. All operations are constant time.

Constructor
public Student(int studentID, String name, double gpa)

➤ Time Complexity: O(1)

Performs 2 simple comparisons and 3 assignments.

➤ Space Complexity: O(1)

Only stores three primitive fields + a String reference.

Getter Methods

getStudentID(), getName(), getGPA()

➤ Time Complexity: O(1)
➤ Space Complexity: O(1)
Setter Methods

setName(), setGPA()

➤ Time Complexity: O(1)
➤ Space Complexity: O(1)
toString()
➤ Time Complexity: O(1)

String concatenation is fixed-size.

➤ Space Complexity: O(1)

Creates a small constant-size string.



StudentRecordManager — Time & Space Complexity

This class uses
TreeMap<Integer, Student> studentRecords;

TreeMap is implemented as a Red-Black Tree, so:

All key operations (put, get, remove, containsKey) run in O(log n).
Iteration over all entries is O(n).

Let n = number of students in the TreeMap.

Method-by-Method Complexity Analysis


Constructor
public StudentRecordManager()

➤ Time: O(1)

Creates an empty TreeMap.

➤ Space: O(1)
insertStudent(Student student)
containsKey() → O(log n)
put() → O(log n)

➤ Time: O(log n)
➤ Space: O(1)
updateStudent(Student student)
removeStudent(student) → O(log n)
insertStudent(student) → O(log n)

➤ Time: O(log n)

Two log n operations → still O(log n).

➤ Space: O(1)
removeStudent(Student student)
containsKey() → O(log n)
remove() → O(log n)

➤ Time: O(log n)
➤ Space: O(1)
updateInsertStudent(Student student)
Behavior:

If ID exists → updateStudent() → O(log n)

If not → insertStudent() → O(log n)

➤ Time: O(log n)
➤ Space: O(1)
retrieveStudentRecord(int studentID)
get() → O(log n)

➤ Time: O(log n)
➤ Space: O(1)
getNumberOfRecords()
studentRecords.size()  → O(1)

➤ Time: O(1)
➤ Space: O(1)
displayStudentRecords() — No filter
for each entry in TreeMap → O(n)

➤ Time: O(n)
➤ Space: O(1)

(Only printing; no additional memory)

displayStudentRecords(double gpaFilter)
loop over entire map → O(n)

➤ Time: O(n)

Even though you're filtering, you still scan every student.

➤ Space: O(1)
toString()
for each entry → O(n)
string concatenations → O(n)

➤ Time: O(n)
➤ Space: O(n)

Because it builds a string proportional to the number of students.

Total Space Complexity of StudentRecordManager

TreeMap stores n student entries.

Each entry stores:

an Integer key

a Student object

➤ Total Space: O(n)
